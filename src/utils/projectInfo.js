It got put on the backburner when I started focusing on MERN while also realizing the true scale of this project for a beginner was was too big. But I plan on rebuilding it in the new tech stack someday. It has a working login/logout system with password hashing, you can add a card to your collection, set a favorite card for your profile and see your most owned card while also displaying community stats. Technically, it\'s fully functional just not fully realized.',
