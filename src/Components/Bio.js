                <p>From the first time I saw the basic HTML I had written come to life in a browser, I knew I had just discovered something I wanted to keep doing for the rest of my life. From making an object change colors when you hover over it, to making React auto-generate a list of boxes based off an array of data, to making a full-blown RESTful api and everything in-between, I absolutely love creating things with code.</p><br></br>

                <p>I have a strong desire to keep learning new technologies. Right now, my main stack focus is the MERN stack but I like to dabble in Vue, PHP and even Python in my freetime so I can broaden my horizon. I would also love to try out Angular, Ruby on Rails and maybe even some sort of game development some day.</p><br></br>

                <p>But in the end, it all comes down to the insatiable desire to see my ideas come to life. I always have the biggest smile when I squash a bug that has been stopping me or when I see a random 2am idea come together the next morning. Coding is a passion I never expected to come across, but once I did, It's all I've wanted to do since.</p>
